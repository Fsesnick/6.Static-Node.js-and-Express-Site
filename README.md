Node.js and Express make a powerful pair when used together on the server side, and are used everyday to make fast, modular and dynamic web applications. For this project, I'll use Node.js, Express and Pug templates to create a portfolio site to show off the projects I've built.</br>

The site  contain a modern landing page, an about page where I share contact info,  and talk a little about myself.</br>

JSON file to store all the data about the projects I've created.</br>

Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.</br>

Node.js and Express to:</br>

Import the required dependencies</br>
Link the JSON with the Pug templates</br>
Set up routes to handle requests</br>
Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS</br>
Handle errors</br>
Set up a server to serve the project</br>
